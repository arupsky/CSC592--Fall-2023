# Advanced Anomaly Detection and Similarity Analysis in SeaSurface Temperatures Across MODIS Orbital Paths Using LSH

**Abstract**
This project introduces an innovative approach to analyzing Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data, utilizing Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to uncover patterns in a substantial dataset comprising 100,000 samples collected over a year. By adapting LSH, a technique not conventionally applied in oceanographic data analysis, our project aimed to efficiently process high-dimensional SST data for identifying similarities and anomalies across various geographic regions. The methodology involved a comprehensive preprocessing phase, including normalization and feature scaling, followed by meticulous tuning of LSH parameters to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and the precision of results. Our analysis yielded insightful findings, revealing a significant consistency in the overall distribution of SST values, as evidenced by high Histogram Intersection scores. Concurrently, we observed distinct, localized variations in SST patterns, highlighting the diverse nature of ocean temperatures. The project overcame difficulties due to the large size and complex nature of the dataset, and adjusting the LSH parameters. Despite these challenges, the outcomes of our project provide valuable contributions to the understanding of SST dynamics. They hold implications for interpreting global climatic phenomena, enhancing predictive models in climate science, and advancing the field of oceanographic data analysis. This project not only demonstrates the utility of LSH in environmental science but also paves the way for its broader application in climate monitoring and marine studies.

**Project Overview**
**Objective:** The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of LSH in analyzing extensive SST datasets, with a specific focus on identifying similiarities and detecting anomalies. LSH, renowned for its computational efficiency in processing large volumes of data, offers a promising alternative to conventional data analysis methods predominantly used in oceanography. This project seeks to leverage the unique capabilities of LSH to identify and categorize complex patterns within SST data and to pinpoint anomalous events among different SST phenomena.
